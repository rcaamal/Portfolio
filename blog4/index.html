      <p>This is my fourth blog for our senior class and this one was also working with
      Visul Studios. This time we worked with ASP.NET MVC 5</p>

      <h2> ASP.NET </h2>

  <div>
    <p> This is my interactive ASP.NET we had to create two interactive weboages
    that had to use the get and post methods. We had to create a converte and
  a color chooser that would use hexadecimal and add them together to be able to give you
another color.</p>

  <div class="container">
  <h2>Metric Converter</h2>
  <p>This is how I got my converstions to show and I Made it look like this becuase
  I felt like displaying them all would be nicer than just one at a time, but even
if that was not what was the assignment, I did make it show.</p>

  <h2>Rounded Corners</h2>

  some how to convert, but i did check how they are calcualted and I tested them out</p>
