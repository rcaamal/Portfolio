      <p>This is my ninenth blog, this time we had to work with Azure and make a database that we will have to
      interact with in our visual studio</p>


      <h2>Azure</h2>

          <h2>Set Up For All Sections</h2>
          <p>While doing this assignment I was not sure how to start or even do this one
          I was stuck and I got helped by the video that I linked up above. I believe this was not
        the way it was supposed to be set up or displayed but I made it this way and tried something
        to get this assignment done. All of the code and from are similar to all of the other sections.</p>

          <h2>The Code For The Client</h2>
          <p> This is how I set it up to be abel to display the data and interact with it.</p>

          <h2>The Code For The Company</h2>
          <p>I used different models to be able to make these views work and display all that I needed
          I did not combine them like the assignment said too, but this is what I could do. I did
        get most of the work done.</p>

          <h2>The Design Of The Company</h2>
          <p>This is how it turned out, most of them will look similar, they will just have differnt
          information</p>

          <h2>The Code For The Purchases</h2>
          <p> I could not get the calcualtions to work with this set up so I am missing someparts.
          However, this is how I got most of the data to display.</p>
