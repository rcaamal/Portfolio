            <p>This is my sixth blog for our senior class and this one was also working with
            Visul Studios and with an already built database. That we had to create a search
          engine to search through the database.</p>

        <h2>Set Up For All Sections</h2>
        <p>While doing this assignment I was not sure how to start or even do this one
        I was stuck and I got helped by the video that I linked up above. I believe this was not
      the way it was supposed to be set up or displayed but I made it this way and tried something
    to get this assignment done. All of the code and from are similar to all of the other sections.</p>

        <h2>The Code For The Client</h2>
        <p> This is how I set it up to be abel to display the data and interact with it.</p>

        <h2>The Code For The Company</h2>
        <p>I used different models to be able to make these views work and display all that I needed
        I did not combine them like the assignment said too, but this is what I could do. I did
      get most of the work done.</p>

        <h2>The Design Of The Company</h2>
        <p>This is how it turned out, most of them will look similar, they will just have differnt
        information</p>

        <h2>The Code For The Purchases</h2>
        <p> I could not get the calcualtions to work with this set up so I am missing someparts.
        However, this is how I got most of the data to display.</p>
