                <p>This is my fifth blog for our senior class and this one was also working with
                Visul Studios. This time we worked with ASP.NET MVC 5</p>

                <h2> ASP.NET </h2>

            </div>
            <div>
              <p> This is my interactive ASP.NET we had to create a webpage that contains a from
              that is able to create a form for the maintenance people to come and fix what was
            requested to be fixed. This form asks for your full name, phonenumber, unit number,
          apartment name, explanatoin of whats wrong, and if you let them come in or not.  </p>
            </div>


            <div class="container">
            <h2>Tennant Request Form</h2>
            <p>This is how my form turned out after I finished the coding to create all this.</p>

            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>This is some of my code that I wrote with the help of our professor that we did an
              example in class. I created it and made the rest to be able to interact wiht our
              form and database./p>

          <div class="container">
            <h2>The Form</h2>
            <p>This is how the form turned out I like the list view becauase normally all of the
              types of form online that we fill out or use for rebates are in a list format. So I kept
              it like this to make it seem like a normal form.

          <div class="container">
            <h2>The Code For The Form</h2>
            <p>Here is some of the code I used to be able to create this form. I got help with the text area
            however while I tried to add more things to interact like the form it would not let me becuase of the database that what
          was created, it kept saying I needed to add more things to make it work and since im trying
          to add more to it, it did not allow me to do that, so I could not finish all of the requirments.</p>

            <p>This is the way the database was set up from adding it using the form Its is all set up, for some reason
              the ones I created ahead of time did not get added but I got them to display.</p>
